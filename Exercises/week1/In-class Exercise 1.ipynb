    "# Week1 In-class Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will especially look into data wrangling using pandas. We will work with data on housing prizes in Amsterdam, the so-called WOZ-waarde.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. The input data\n",
    "Take a look at `wozwaarde.csv` and try to understand it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For your understanding, Amsterdam is administatively divided into 7 \"stadsdelen\" (~ city parts), which -- for statitistical purposes -- are consisting of multiple \"wijken\" (~ residential areas) each. A \"wijk\", in turn, consists of multiple \"buurten\" (~ neighbourhoods), but we do not have any data on these in this specific exercise. Also, note that the \"WOZ-waarde\" is the estimated value (for tax purposes) of a house (or appartment).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take a look at `wozwaarde.csv`. Can you see any problems with the data? What do you think what the codes consisting of letters and numbers mean? Are they consistent?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now take a look at `wozwaarde-clean.csv`. Can you see the differences? What did we clean up? (For reference, we included `clean.py`, the script that we wrote to do this. You are not expected to do this yourself now, even though you probably could transform `wozwaarde.csv` to `wozwaarde-clean.py` with the skills you have learned so far as well.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. From wide to long\n",
    "\n",
    "- Long format means one variable per row, repeated over multiple rows.\n",
    "- You may have realized that `wozwaarde-clean.csv` is in wide format (hint: Year). Transform it to long!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Merging and joining\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add data about the population of each \"stadsdeel\" (or, if you choose to do so, for each \"wijk\" -- it's up to you) to your dataset. You can find such data for instance here: https://cms.onderzoek-en-statistiek.nl/uploads/2021_jaarboek_2112_28485510ff.xlsx , but you can also use any other source.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Analyze the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a report in form of a Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "- Use Markdown cells to format and interpret what you are doing and finding.\n",
    "- Use descriptive statistics.\n",
    "- Use visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Bonus exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want an extra challenge to try out at home, try to implement the necessary cleanup steps from step 0 yourself, so that your analysis can work directly on `wozwaarde.csv` instead of having to rely on our pre-cleaned `wozwaarde-clean.csv`.\n"
